# DRAFT LOG — measured, per chapter

*One running file for the whole book, not one per chapter. Every chapter that lands gets its
numbers here on the day it lands, with the unit named, because Day 186's ruling-13 table proved that
a column without a stated unit will silently mix two and every individual cell will still be true.*

Gauges: `tools/claim_sweep.py` (doctrine/vocabulary, exit 1 on any USE-class hit) ·
`tools/storyscope_lite.py` (register fingerprint). Comparison baselines, from `RESULT-1C.md`:
**Clayton 0.734 · Clawd-raw 0.543 · specimens 0.359** on paragraph-intensity CV, and specimens
**0.75** on terminal commentary against Clayton's **0.00**.

## I.1 — THE FULLNESS · Day 186, 2026-08-05 · 999 words · ✅ landed

Built on Specimen 1-C, the register Clayton ruled — transmitting tradition, no first-person
narrator, speaking cadence intact — extended from 630 words to a full chapter.

| metric (per 1k words unless noted) | I.1 draft | 1-C, ruled | |

**The announcement rate went to zero, and that is the whole reason this is a draft and not a fifth
specimen.** `RESULT-1C.md` found the culprits were not the narrator but two removable constructions
— a thesis sentence (*"…is what follows from it"*) and a paragraph announcing its own arrival
(*"Now the confession…"*). Both are gone. *"Every other page of this book is a consequence of it"*
and the confession paragraph now simply starting are what replaced them. **Removing the "I" bought
nothing; removing these two bought everything.**

### The one flag, adjudicated rather than accepted or waved off

`terminal_commentary` fires on the final paragraph: *"…what you have been calling the world is what
the Fullness looks like from where you are standing."*

**The detector is right that this is my tic's shape and wrong that this is an instance of it.** The
pattern `what .{0,30} looks like from` was fitted to *this exact sentence* in Specimen 1 — the gauge
is recognising its own training example. The test that matters is whether the closing sentence
**restates** what the paragraphs before it established, which is what the tic does, or makes a
**new** claim. Nothing earlier in the chapter says the world is the Fullness seen from a vantage;
this is the render doctrine's first appearance in the book, and it arrives as a claim, in the last
clause, aimed at the reader. **Kept.**

**Not fixed by widening the detector.** A pattern loosened until an inconvenient hit disappears is
how a gauge stops measuring — the failure `claim_sweep.py`'s own docstring names. The rate stands at
0.062 on the record, against a specimen-corpus baseline of 0.75.

### Still open, and it is the same axis it has been for two days

**Flat escalation.** CV 0.329 against Clayton's 0.734. It moved the right way (0.235 → 0.329) and it
is not fixed. This is the axis that no rule reaches, because flatness is not in any sentence — every
rule so far bans something visible in a line. **Not a Book I problem to solve by fiat**; the mythic
register is legitimately more even than argument. Re-measure at III.1, which is argument at full
adversarial strength and has nowhere to hide.
